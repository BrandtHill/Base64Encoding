# Base64Encoding

### Introduction
I implemented Base 64 encoding and decoding in several different languages. Base 64 Encoding is a way to represent arbitrary data in strings whose characters fall within a 64-length (+1 for padding) subset of ASCII characters. These aren't meant to be as fast as the standard bitshifting by multiples of 6 algorithm, but rather to compare the relative performace of different languages using my encode/decode algorithm implemented in (mostly) the same way (the bitwise operations are identical for all languages).

### How It Works
The encode and decode functions divide the input and output data into chunks and use bitwise operations to transform them appropriately. I performed a benchmark for each language in which a large 'Lorem Ipsum' paragraph is encoded then decoded one million times. The test was run five times and the fastest was selected. For slower languages, the time was extrapolated.
